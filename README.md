# ColorPicker
tried to use Bunifuframework with this project
didnt manage to use it much, if at all
simple color picker
doesnt drag and drop bcs I messed up something with the ui when I removed the ugly default close button
press start 
select the color
the colors tell you how much of red and green and blue there is 
the HEX button is a toggle that goes between HEX state and RGB state
